# Atlas-Gittergenerator (QGIS Plugin)

**Atlas-Gittergenerator** is a QGIS plugin that generates a regular grid overlay based on the extent of a selected vector layer and a user-defined scale. It is particularly useful for creating print layouts (Atlas) with consistent coverage across a geographic area.
